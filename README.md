Learning Design Studio <sup>HE</sup>
==========================
Learning Design Studio <sup>HE</sup> (LDS<sup>HE</sup>) is a pedagogically grounded productivity and collaboration platform for professionals in the Learning Design (LD), Learning Analytics (LA), and Education communities (particularly those interested in using LD to support Teacher Inquiry of Student Learning (TISL)). To do so requires a common design language that can (1) capture well-constructed pedagogical practices and the underpinning learning design principles, as well as specify the necessary learning analytics appropriate for the intended learning outcomes and chosen pedagogy, and (2) be understood by practitioners and researchers in all of the three targeted communities.

To setup LDS<sup>HE</sup> in your own server, please visit the [ldshe-docker](https://github.com/ldshe/ldshe-docker/) repository.

This project is part of the HKUST MIT Research Alliance Consortium project "An Open Learning Design, Data Analytics & Visualization Framework for E-Learning (ITS/306/15FP)", funded by the Innovative Technology Fund of the HKSAR. For detail please visit: https://ldshe.cite.hku.hk.
