                <b>LDS<sup>HE</sup></b> is developed under an Hong Kong Government funded project (ITF/306/15FP), titled
                <i>“An Open Learning Design, Data Analytics and Visualization Framework for e-Learning”</i>.
                This is a joint institutional project led by researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST, lead institution),
                The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
                The aim of the joint project is to serve MOOC users (instructors, instructional designers, institutional curriculum leaders and learning scientists) by developing an open framework that integrates three major e-learning technology components.
